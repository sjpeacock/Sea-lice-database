## Abstract

The global expansion of aquaculture has changed the structure of fish populations in coastal environments, with implications for disease dynamics. In Pacific Canada, farmed salmon act as reservoir hosts for parasites and pathogens, including sea lice (*Lepeophtheirus salmonis* and *Caligus clemensi*) that can transmit to migrating wild salmon.  Assessing the impact of salmon farms on wild salmon requires regular monitoring of sea-louse infections on both farmed and wild fish. Since 2001, we have collected juvenile pink (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) and chum (*O. keta*) salmon annually at three sites in the Broughton Archipelago in British Columbia, Canada, during the annual juvenile-salmon migration from freshwater to the open ocean.  From sampled fish, we recorded counts of parasitic copepodid-, chalimus-, and motile-stage sea lice.  We report louse abundances as well as supplementary observations of fish size, development, and health.

## Introduction

Increased salmon aquaculture production over the past several decades (Goldburg and Naylor 2005) has been associated with the decline of wild salmonid stocks around the world (Ford and Myers 2008).  On the west coast of Canada, the expansion of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture has raised concerns about impacts to wild salmon as a result of the amplification of naturally occurring parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi).  In certain areas of coastal British Columbia (BC), sea-louse infestations on salmon farms have been implicated in wild-salmon population declines (Krkosek et al. 2011b).  

For some populations of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), juveniles must migrate directly past open-net salmon farms anchored near to shore as they migrate from their natal streams and rivers to open-ocean habitats.   Along these routes, sea lice can disperse from farmed salmon and infect juvenile wild salmon, often before the wild salmon develop protective scales, leading to increased predation susceptibility an reduced survival (Krko?ek et al. 2006, 2011a).  Pink salmon populations have shown significantly reduced productivity when louse levels are high (Krkosek et al. 2011b), however, chum salmon have not (Peacock et al. 2014). Recent farm-management practices appear to have halted earlier declines in pink salmon productivity (Peacock et al. 2013), although sea louse infestation levels were once again elevated in 2015 (Bateman et al., in review).

Since 2001, we have carried out monitoring of sea-louse infestation levels on wild-caught juvenile pink and chum salmon in the Broughton Archipelago, BC, an area of active salmon aquaculture. The data we have collected have been used to quantify temporal trends in parasites burdens to inform questions of ecological, conservation, management and policy relevance. Here, we make these data that have resulted from this long term monitoring program available.
